# Answer of Question2 
 Sample classes are implemented in the android projects in specified folders.

## Answer of 2(a)
 To create car and plane class we can implement the Vehicle interface. Both classes will override the abstract methods of Vehicle interface. In this pattern the classes will not inherit the Interface and also can able to use the methods as common functionality. Both the classes can implement any other interfaces if there is any need. 

## Answer of 2(b)
 This can be designed in different approach. An abstract class Vehicle with similar methods can be created. Car and Plane class will inherit that class by extending the Vehicle abstract class. But it cannot inherit any other class and also can implement necessary interfaces. The Vehicle class can also declare any fields if it is necessary.
